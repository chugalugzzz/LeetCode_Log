1. The index of elements in an array starts from 0.
2. The memory addresses of an array are contiguous.
3. The size of an array is fixed, the elements cannot be removed, only can be **overwritten**. Delete an element in an array can only replace it with a new value, but the array size remains unchanged.(Use **ArrayList** for actual deletion.)
